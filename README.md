# Carrel-Management-System
A system (built with Django) to book desks in Dana Porter Library during peak times such as midterms and finals. 

# Motivation

During finals at the end of my first term, I often lost my seat in Dana Porter library for just going to the bathroom or downstairs for a snack. I figured it would be a good idea to create something that will alert others around that a desk is occupied and prevent some from walking in the cold all the way to library, only to find there are no seats left. This project is a beta version of this tool built using Django.

# Tech and Frameworks Used

It's pretty much all Django! (Despite what GitHub says). I used bootstrap for the photo carousel on the carrel selection page. A lot of HTML and CSS as well. However, the goal is to become a better python developer, so I focused more on the backend. Checkout the sick models.py, views.py and forms.py files ðŸ˜Ž.

# Special Features

I included real maps of Dana Porter Library floors from this website: https://testtube.uwaterloo.ca/whereisit/index.cfm?CFID=54552fb6-30af-42d8-8a54-e93e1f4207d8&CFTOKEN=0  

I would be amazing if the libraries at UWaterloo could support this project! The coolest feature is that as students select their program when registering, in future versions, they will be able to see who from their program is nearby, and thus coordinate impromptu study sessions!

# Installation

If you plan to run this (which I hope you do) do note this was the virtual environment I was working with: 
Django==2.2
pytz==2019.3
sqlparse==0.3.0

# How to Use?

I would be happily put this project on netlify if there's enough interests! Stay tuned for it to be up as well as a demo!

Big shoutout to this tutorial for getting me started with Django. It is literally the best programming tutorial I have ever watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4
